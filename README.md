# Self-supervised Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification

This project evaluates the effectiveness of self-supervised Predictive Learning using the **BEiT** architecture on medical image classification tasks. 
We fine-tune a pre-trained BEiT model on datasets from the **MedMNIST** library (BreastMNIST and PneumoniaMNIST), showcasing its generalization ability in domain-shifted tasks.
